<br/>

This is community guideline is to help and manage the community to behave and have a healthy communication within our community.

These rules are here to make sure the community stays a place where people of all skill levels and backgrounds can flourish.

<br/>


## Rules

### 1. Keep the learning environment positive

Everybody is here for the same reason: to learn and share knowledge.

**Spoon Feeding**

This is when you give someone the solution without letting them figure it out. It doesn't help them learn and it's generally just a waste of time.

**Language Flaming**

Unless constructive, keep any opinions about how much you dislike languages or tools to yourself. It doesn't benefit anyone at all.

**Gatekeeping**

This describes when someone takes it upon themselves to set a standard for something (like eg. "good code"), and uses that as an excuse to tell somebody else that they aren't able to learn or do something. Remember we're all here to learn and improve.

**Nitpicking**

Keep criticism constructive. Fixating on minor details or deliberately picking holes in someone's work is something that should be avoided.

**Backseat driving**

If somebody is already getting help, do not jump in the middle of the conversation. Do not turn a simple question into a "too many cooks in the kitchen" problem. If you think you have something to contribute, ask if you can join into the conversation.

**Opinions for beginner languages**

The FAQ and beginner guide represent many hours of discussion to find well-rounded answers to common questions. Please link to them regularly when beginners ask questions those guides answer.

**Academic dishonesty**

This means cheating on your school work, paying someone to do your school work or trying to avoid your school work in any way. It's unethical and will not be tolerated here.

<br/>

### 2. Be nice

Remember the human treat everyone with respect regardless of their skill level or differences in thoughts.

**Arguing from authority**

Nobody likes a know-it-all, and presenting your opinion as fact isn't the way to participate constructively. If you're sharing an anecdote or example from your experience, that's totally fine, but make that clear, and don't present it as concrete evidence of something being a certain way.

<br/>

### 3. No illegal or prohibited topics / Security and hacking

**Do not discuss anything prohibited by law or a service's Terms of Service (ToS)**

This includes, but is not limited to: piracy, video game cheats/hacks, hacking, web scraping, running automated tools against a website or service against the ToS, and so on. Basically anything that the website or service in question does not allow, we won't either.

**Do not talk about hacking**

Do not talk about Hacking, “offensive security”, or similar topics. This includes, but is not limited to: reverse engineering and decompiling. Light talk about preventing and best practices for coding with security in mind are allowed. Everyone should be aware of and make a good effort to write secure code, but discussions around how to bypass a system will not be allowed.

**Do not post NSFW content**

Content should be kept to a PG13 level. Always ask yourself "Would my boss be okay with this fullscreen on my monitor as he walked by?". If the answer is no, don't post it.

**Don't post controversial Contents**

No content which leads to any controversy shall be posted in the group.

<br/>

### 4. Don't obstruct moderation

These rules try to cover as much as possible but unforseenable situations could arise and will be up to the staff's discretion

**Do not impersonate staff**

Don't pretend to be staff; this includes but is not limited to: copying their profile picture, putting a hammer emoji in your name, having the same name as a staff member and pretending to be a member of the staff team.

**Follow the spirit of the rules**

This speaks for itself: don't be difficult or generally a pain in the ass by trying to find loop holes in the rules or skirt around them.

**No Minimodding**

Minimodding will not be tolerated in the server. A user is considered minimodding if they try to moderate a conversation without being a staff member. This includes repeatedly pointing out to a user that something is against the rules. If you suspect a member is breaking a rule, do not engage. Avoid piling on the user with macros or redirects. Alert one of our staff members.

<br/>

### 5. Stay on topic

**Don't derail constructive conversation**

Technical and language channels need to be kept on topic, meaning these channels are not the place to have random conversations or to post things unrelated to that specific channel. If there's an on-going conversation taking place, do not jump in with something completely unrelated.

**No life advice**

This includes, but is not limited to: relationship advice, depression or suicidal talk. We are not qualified to offer professional advice; it just does not belong here. Note that career-related advice is fine.

<br/>

### 6. No solicitation or advertising

**No advertising**

Do not advertise anything you stand to benefit from.

Exceptions to this rule are rarely made; if you'd like to request such an exception, please contact Mod directly.

**Direct Messaging**

If you direct message people instead of posting in the right channel, you're preventing others from learning from the conversation. We have plenty of channels, use one of them. Do not send uninvited DMs.

**No recruitment or asking for free work**

BTN Developer Community is not a recruitment platform for programmers for your project. There are plenty of sites out there specifically designed for this purpose. If you have an open source project that meets our content policy, then you may post it in a relevant channel, but no other forms of recruitments are allowed.

<br/>

### 7. Use @Mod to contact staff

**@Mod in Discord**

Please use @Mod to contact moderators or admins in the community discord server.
